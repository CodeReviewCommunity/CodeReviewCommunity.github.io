## To do

* HTML: Add shortcut icon file (the same as CR?)
* HTML: Rework 404 with the other pages
* CSS: Use minified `normalize.css`
* CSS: Use minified stylesheets for production and extended stylesheets for developing
* Misc: Add Google Analytics ID
* Misc: Maintain the `humans.txt`: Add TEAM + HELPERS; Update used technologies after reworking pages
* Misc: What is the empty `.gitignore` doing in `/img/`. Probably moving it to `root` and add some general rules (OS junk files etc.)
* Misc: Maybe remove some of the things the HTML5 Boilerplate adds.
